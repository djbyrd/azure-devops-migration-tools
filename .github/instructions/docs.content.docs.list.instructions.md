# Documentation Standards

All documentation content **must stay in sync with the codebase**.  
List pages automatically show the `description` from the front matter, followed by cards for each sub-page. This layout is applied automatically.

---

## Front Matter

- Only edit the `description`.  
- The `description` must be **SEO/GEO friendly**:  
  - Use clear, relevant keywords.  
  - Keep it concise, about 150–160 characters.  
  - Write for humans first.

---

## Content

The content appears **after the list of sub-pages**.  
It must describe the overall purpose of the collection or section, based on an **inspection of all current sub-pages**.

Write **concise generalisms** that:
- Summarise common themes, capabilities, and patterns found across the sub-pages.  
- Call out notable variations only when they matter to readers choosing where to go next.  
- Link to one or two representative sub-pages when helpful, not an exhaustive list.

---

## Rules

- Content appears **after the auto-generated list of sub-pages**; do not add additional lists.  
- Use the content to give context and orientation, not item-level documentation.  
- Base statements on an actual review of all sub-pages in the section.  
- Keep wording concise and consistent with the page’s keywords, and ensure the `description` aligns with the content.  
- Update this content whenever sub-pages are added, removed, or materially changed.
